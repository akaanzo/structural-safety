# Structural Safety Exercise
_Jupyter notebooks_ using for Structural Safety course at University of Trento. The purpose is calculate and dimension a continuous beam and two different columns of a commercial building following the current italian constructions law (NTC 2018).
There is a notebook [___loads___](./loads.ipynb) about calculation of loads acting on the building, [***beam_sol***](./beam_sol.ipynb) containing the beam solution and the combination cases (included the bending moment and shear envelopes) and last but not least [***col_sol***](./col_sol.ipynb) about axial forces of columns P27 and P36.

Moreover, the LaTeX report title page is based on [Nicola Meoli project](https://github.com/sononicola/Topografia_Relazione).
