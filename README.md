# Structural Safety Exercise
This repository contains _jupyter notebooks_ using for Structural Safety course at University of Trento. The purpose is calculate and dimension a continuous beam and two different columns of a commercial building following the current italian constructions law (NTC 2018).
There is a notebook [___loads___](./loads.ipynb) about calculation of loads acting on the building and another one [***sol***](./sol.ipynb) containing the beam solution and the combination cases (included the bending moment and shear envelope).
